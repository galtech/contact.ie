<h1>The Trees</h1>
<h2>By Philip Larkin</h2>

<p>The trees are coming into leaf<br>
Like something almost being said;<br>
The recent buds relax and spread,<br>
Their greenness is a kind of grief.</p>

<p>Is it that they are born again<br>
And we grow old? No, they die too.<br>
Their yearly trick of looking new<br>
Is written down in rings of grain.</p>

<p>Yet still the unresting castles thresh<br>
In fullgrown thickness every May.<br>
Last year is dead, they seem to say,<br>
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.</p>
